Create a full-screen crypto trading dashboard with a dark cyberpunk aesthetic inspired by the NSDEX interface. The layout should be a complex multi-panel design with the following specifications:
Overall Design:

Dark navy/black background (#0a0a1a to #1a1a2e gradient)
Neon blue accents (#00d4ff, #0099ff)
Retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic with scan lines and CRT monitor effects
Glowing borders and subtle animations on all panels
Matrix-style rain effect or particle animation in the background

Layout Structure (CSS Grid):
Header (full width)
Left Sidebar (20%) | Main Content (60%) | Right Sidebar (20%)
Footer (full width)
Components to Include:

Header Bar:

Retro terminal style with "Welcome to my Cyber realm" text
ASCII art decorative borders
Glowing blue text effects


Left Sidebar:

Navigation panel with glowing hover effects
Status indicators with pulsing animations
Live market ticker with scrolling text
Meme corner with rotating images (placeholder slots for crypto memes)


Main Content Area:

Large trading chart with animated candlesticks
Real-time price display with number animations
Buy/Sell buttons with neon glow effects
Market sentiment indicator with animated gauge
Latest updates feed with typewriter text effect


Right Sidebar:

User profile card with avatar placeholder

Special Effects:

Typography:

Primary font: "Orbitron" or "Share Tech Mono" for headers
Secondary font: "Roboto Mono" for body text
All text should have subtle text-shadow glow effects

Color Palette:

Background: #0a0a1a, #1a1a2e
Primary neon: #00d4ff, #0099ff
Success/Buy: #00ff88
Danger/Sell: #ff0044
Text: #ffffff with 0.9 opacity
Accent gold: #ffd700

Responsive Design:

On mobile: Stack all panels vertically
Maintain aspect ratios for charts and images
Hide decorative elements on small screens
Keep core functionality accessible

Animation Requirements:

CSS animations for all hover states
Smooth transitions (0.3s ease)
Pulsing effects on important elements
Loading animations for data sections
Parallax scrolling effects

Interactive Elements:

All buttons should have press animations
Dropdown menus with slide effects
Modal popups with blur background
Draggable panels (if possible)
Keyboard shortcuts display

Performance Notes:

Use CSS transforms for animations (not position changes)
Implement lazy loading for images
Optimize all animations for 60fps
Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout

Additional Features:

Dark mode is the only mode (no light theme)
Custom scrollbars with neon styling
Loading states with skeleton screens
Error states with glitch effects
Success states with particle explosions

Make sure every element feels alive and interactive. The goal is to create an immersive trading experience that makes users feel like they're in a high-tech command center. Use placeholder content for all text, charts, and data - focus on the visual design and interactive experience.
